*** Restaurant Explore ***

-INTRODUCTION
Welcome to this Python project that utilizes the Yelp API to search for and display restaurant information 
based on user input. The project is implemented using the Tkinter library for creating the graphical 
user interface (GUI) and the requests library for making API requests.

-HOW TO USE IT
To begin using this application, you'll need to install an integrated development 
environment (IDE) or a text editor. While any IDE would work, I recommend using 
PyCharm is a widely used and user-friendly Python IDE. You can download it here: 
->https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/?section=windows

Additionally, you will need to obtain a Yelp API.
a critical component of this project:
->https://docs.developer.yelp.com/docs/fusion-authentication

Once you have gathered the API and Client ID, save it in the api.txt.

-HOW TO RUN IT
Once you've installed the required IDE and downloaded the code files.
Within PyCharm you can just run the current file which in this case will
be main.cpp.

** TECHNICAL **
-Error Handling in cases where the request to the Yelp API didn't work
-Using the Tkinter library to produce a themed window for users
-Updates content base on User's input
