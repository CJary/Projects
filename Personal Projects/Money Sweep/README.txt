*** BANK SIMULATION AND GAMBLING SYSTEM ***

-INTRODUCTION
Welcome to this comprehensive command-line application that seamlessly integrates 
a user management system with an exciting gambling game. The program offers both registration 
and login functionalities, enabling users to create accounts, manage their information, 
and engage in a thrilling minesweeper-like gambling game with potential winnings.

-HOW TO USE IT
To begin using this application, you'll need to install an integrated development 
environment (IDE) or a text editor. While any IDE would work, I recommend using 
Visual Studio Code is a widely used and user-friendly text editor. You can download it here: 
->https://code.visualstudio.com/download

-HOW TO RUN IT
Once you've installed the required text editor and downloaded the code files, 
navigate to the directory containing the main.cpp file using the terminal. 
If you're using Visual Studio Code, it conveniently handles this for you. 
To compile the code, execute the following command in the terminal:
g++ *.cpp

After successful compilation, run the executable file with the following command:
a.exe

-USER MANAGEMENT SYSTEM USER
