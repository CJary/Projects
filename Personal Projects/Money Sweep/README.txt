*** BANK SIMULATION AND GAMBLING SYSTEM ***

-INTRODUCTION
This program is designed to be a User interface and Gambling system

-HOW TO USE IT
All you would need is to install any IDE or text editor. However, I used 
VISUAL STUDIO CODE which is a common text editor. Link to install it:
->https://code.visualstudio.com/download

-HOW TO RUN IT
After installing and downloading the code files, you would need to path
the terminal to the file that contains the main.cpp files. By using cd.
VS Code does that for you. 
Need to run this command:
g++ *.cpp

This compiles it then you would need to run the executable:
a.exe
