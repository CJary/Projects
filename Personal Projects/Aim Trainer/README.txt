*** 2D AIM TRAINER SFML GAME ***

-INTRODUCTION
This game was programmed and developed by me with the help of SFML framework.
I started this project because it was a really fun idea I can share and enjoy with my friends.
I hope it would help others in the future.

-HOW TO ACTUALLY USE IT
First, this program is done around VISUAL STUDIO ver 2022. Not visual studio code
a lot of my friends get that confused. 
In order to get the VISUAL STUDIO ver 2022 here is a link:

-HOW TO CUSTOMIZE
All of the visual aspect of the game is provided in the folder at my github:
->https://github.com/CJary/Projects/tree/main/Personal%20Projects/Aim%20Trainer

You can download your own background, target, fonts, etc...
However to connect them you have to access each part of the function to path it to the image
you downloaded.
->initEnemies, initFonts, Game Constructor in the Game.cpp File.

-HOW TO PLAY
After everything is finish, you can just run the game and the game window will appear.
You just have shoot as many target and as fast as possible to achieve your highest score
given the time frame.
