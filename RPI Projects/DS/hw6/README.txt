ALGORITHM ANALYSIS:
What's the order notation of your algorithm?
O(L*26 * 26^(ROW * COl))
row and col being the row and col of the input
L is the longest word length


TEST CASE SUMMARY:
How did your program perform on the different test cases?  Summarize
the running times.  (It's ok if it didn't finish the harder examples.)
What new test cases did you create and how did it perform on those
tests?

It ran decently fast for most of them however, for test case like 7, 8
it took a bit longer with 7 being around 2.69s and 8 being around 2.19s

I created new test cases that are bigger than these test cases such as 5x5.
It took around like idk took a while :
5 5
+jaryc
+valor
+hater
+real
-z
-m
This shows me that if the words don't overlap it's gonna take a while
